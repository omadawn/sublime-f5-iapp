================

## Description

Sublime Text 2 plugin for iApp syntax highlighting

## Installation

Open up a command line in the Packages/ folder of your Sublime user folder and execute the following:

```
# For MacOS
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
git clone https://github.com/bitwisecook/sublime-f5-iapp.git
```

Then modify the syntax specific preferences for this syntax.
First make sure you have an APL syntax file open and Go to:
Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific - User
And make sure it looks like this:

```
{
	"extensions":
	[
		"iappp"
	],
	"color_scheme": "/Users/<Your User Name>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/<What you named this package>/iappPresentationColor.tmTheme"
}
```

If the file is empty you can simply add the color scheme line within curly braces.
